[{"content":"I play a character called zeynarz on the internet, a pwn player from the international ctf team thehackerscrew. Sometimes, I play ctfs solo as well. I mainly play pwn, but I\u0026rsquo;m currently learning crypto too.\nI\u0026rsquo;m very interested in how computers work under the hood, and likes to do computer programming and hacking (specifically pwn/binary exploitation) for fun. I enjoy creative problem solving a lot, and like to practice on websites like pwnable.tw and cryptohack. I also like to work on low level things (as well as of course, breaking them). I have a keen interest in electronics and robotics as well, and how these fields can be used to reshape our world.\nI started learning pwn in late 2020 by watching LiveOverflow\u0026rsquo;s binary exploitation playlist, and learned how computers actually worked by following a great course called nand2tetris in 2021. Massive thanks to LiveOverflow and the nand2tetris team for helping me lay the foundation of my pwn and computer science knowledge, as well as sparking my curiousity in hacking and how computers work.\nAchievements (kinda)  5th in Imaginary CTF 2023 [with thehackerscrew] 10th in SEETF 2023 [with thehackerscrew] 13th in GrayCTF Quals [with thehackerscrew] 8th in Codegate Junior Finals 2023 [solo] 25th in Codegate Junior Quals 2023 [solo] 33rd in Space Heroes CTF 2023 [solo] 38th in Hacker\u0026rsquo;s Playground 2023 [solo]  ","permalink":"https://zeynarz.github.io/aboutme/","summary":"aboutme","title":"刘智仁 (zhiren)"}]
